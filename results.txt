C/weights_100.pth - delta_correction=0.15, steer_min = 0.1, relatively stable but requires anticipation
H/weights_80.pth - delta_correction=0.15, steer_min = 0.1, relatively stable, requires less anticipation than C/weights_100.pth, can see delta_correction in action
***Results above are before reshape vs permute issue***
***Results below are after reshape vs permute fix***
K/weights_40.pth - delta_correction=0.15, steer_min = 0.1, corrects itself well
K/weights_80.pth - delta_correction=0.15, steer_min = 0.1, corrects itself even better than 40.pth
